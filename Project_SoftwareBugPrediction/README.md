# ICS 485 : Machine Learning - Task3: Neural Networks

## Term Project: Software Bug Prediction

This is the neural networks section of the project.

**Team member:** Faris Hijazi s201578750

There are 2 solution files:
- [Project_SoftwareBugPrediction\proj-task1-2.ipynb]() (solved by other team members)
- [Project_SoftwareBugPrediction\proj-task3-NeuralNetworks.ipynb]() which is my part (Faris Hijazi)

**Abstract:** Develop advanced machine learning-based classification models to
satisfactorily classify **software bugs** (binary and multiclass) for data collected at the
University of Geneva in Switzerland.

**Dataset:** The dataset is related to the bug prediction dataset. It contains data about the
following software systems:
- Eclipse JDT Core
- Eclipse PDE UI
- Equinox Framework
- Lucene
- Mylyn

## Problem statement

Find it in the [Project_SoftwareBugPrediction\ICS485-Project.pdf]() file.
here are the problem statement tasks:

**Task 1 :** Provide **3 different binary classifiers** ...

**Task 2 :** Provide **3 different multiclassifiers** to predict the bugs ( **0, 1, and 2** ) given ...

**Task 3 :** Train a **feedforward neural network** to predict ...
