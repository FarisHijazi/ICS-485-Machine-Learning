# ICS-485-Machine-Learning
My personal assignment and project submissions in the ICS485 (Machine Learning) course at KFUPM.

There are 7 assignments (and som bonus assignments) and a project.
Now excuse the messy git history, I only decided to commit my changes after finishing them.

The most interesting part in my opinion is my part in the project here:
[proj-task3-NeuralNetworks.ipynb](Project_SoftwareBugPrediction/proj-task3-NeuralNetworks.ipynb)

Where I make multiple neural networks and try different types of data balancing and I automate and pipeline this process.
And at the end I compare with plots
